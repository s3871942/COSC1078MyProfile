                  <h1>A Virtual Companion</h1>
               </header>
               <h3>Concept</h3>
               <p>A virtual companion that lives in your mobile device and presented as a virtual mascot that travels freely on your apps providing assistance and improving different aspects of the users’ everyday life, with the users’ wellbeing at its core operation. Whether that is providing personalised advice to improve overall wellbeing, to providing companionship to the user. Highly interactive and able to sync up to the internet and the ever-advancing technology in our modern world, the virtual assistant will be able to assist in simple everyday tasks to increase the quality of life for the user.<br>
                  <br><i>Looking for a recipe to cook? Want to find the latest news? Or maybe you’d like to call or text someone? Just ask your virtual companion and they will do it for you. No need to pick up your phone.</i>
               </p>
               <h3>Inspiration</h3>
               <p>What inspired this project for me was Queer Eye on Netflix. In the show nominees are selected to receive a makeover from the Fab 5, five gay men who each specialise in Culture, Food, Fashion, Grooming and Design. Each episode will focus on one nominee, exposing the story and struggle that have led their life into disarray. Through the episode the Fab 5 teach the nominee simple, but often overlooked, skills such as self-care and understanding their self-worth to help them build up confidence and overcome their individual struggles and take their first step in moving forward with their lives.
                  <br>
                  <br>Ignorance of healthy eating or not knowing how to cook. Leading a busy lifestyle and not being able to find time to relax and unwind. Not physically presenting ourselves at our 100% because we lack the confidence to try a different style or simply lack the knowledge. All these things can drastically affect an individual’s mental wellbeing and quality of life. A messy life is a manifestation of a messy mind. And that’s where the virtual companion comes in.

               <p>With the focus on companionship, this concept is different compared to other virtual assitants on the market. This virtual companion will be able to initiate interaction with the user. Simple things such as saying “good morning” when the user wakes up or asking how the user’s day was once they get home. Based on the user’s response, the virtual assistant can provide suggestions targeted towards improving the user’s wellbeing. For example, you’ve just come home from a run and you’re sprawled on the couch. You’re all sweaty, tired, and dehydrated. Your virtual companion knows you’ve been on a run based on GPS tracking and your daily planner that it’s synced to. It’ll ask you how your run was, and after you respond, proceed to suggest cool-down exercises to relax and stretch out muscles or a juice/smoothie recipe to refresh and rehydrate. Or, say you just got off the phone after making plans with your best friend; your virtual companion will create a new event on your calendar app for you to confirm and lock in.
                  <br>
                  <br>As mentioned before the virtual companion’s intent is to encourage healthier choices to improve the user’s wellbeing. By monitoring the user’s activities and habits it can provide suggestions and alternatives for users to look after themselves. Screen time information can be used to encourage users to take a break more often from their phones, or suggest an alternative activity to encourage the user to be more active. If the user is up late getting lost into videos because they can’t sleep, the virtual companion will politely remind the user it’s late and provide a list of techniques found on the web to help encourage sleep. Perhaps the user has been ordering take out too much lately, then the virtual companion will suggest quick and easy recipes for the user to encourage healthier eating.
                  <br>
                  <br>Technology is at the point where a lot of information can be tracked. By utilising this information it’s possible for the virtual companion to achieve a deeper level of interaction with the user. Smart technology is also becoming more advanced especially when it comes to homes and designs. Modern homes can now have multiple elements controlled remotely on a single system: lights, blinds, heating, cooling, entertainment, security, etc. Users will be able to use their virtual assistant to synchronise and control their smart-home system. This will allow the virtual companion to feel more real like an entity and provide the user strong control over their environment.
                  <br>
                  <br>All these features thus far show the potential the virtual companion has in assisting users in their everyday life. However, to help make the virtual companion feel “alive”, it should be able to express emotions. Even if it is just a pre-programed response, it will allow the user to connect to the virtual assistant on a deeper emotional level. To achieve this, emotions will simply be expressed via the virtual assistant’s model when paired with specific responses.

               <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
               <p>The creation of the virtual assistant will require a program language such as JavaScript that we can use as building blocks and Eclipse as the language editor to manipulate said building blocks. To help us develop and train the complex algorithms we’ll need a software library for dataflow and differentiable programming, which will act as a framework for neural networks and machine learning. To do this we can use TensorFlow, which is an open-source machine learning library which helps to develop machine learning models.</p>
               <h3>Skills Required</h3>
               <p>The project aims to create a virtual companion, therefore extensive programming skills are required to bring this project to life. Being able to write programs, develop software and creating complex algorithms is a must. The project aims to create a virtual assistant that will learn the user’s habits over time and become personalised to the individual. The project will require the use of specific and specialised programs, which would require strong knowledge and study into the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
               <h3>Outcome</h3>
               <p>The outcome of this project is to create more than just a virtual assistant that provides convenience, but to create a companion for users to connect with. Humans are social creatures and crave some form of intrapersonal interactions, which is very evident now considering the state of the world. Covid-19 and the isolation we all have experienced from quarantine has shown us how hard it can be to go without social interaction. As our mental health declines, we start to neglect our diet, appearance, and therefore our overall physical health. The virtual companion can negate this decline and achieve making this connection with the right responses that encourage us to be our best self.</p>
