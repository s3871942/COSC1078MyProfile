<h2>A profile</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is Tung Nguyen.
My family is from Vietnam and migrated to Melbourne, Australia in the 80’s before they had me.  After high school I moved out and have lived in many different suburbs around Melbourne, but for the time being I’m back in my home town of Glen Waverley with my family.
I’m currently enrolled into the COVID-19 IT short course at RMIT.
Hobbies I indulge in my spare time include watching anime and gaming, especially lately as we’ve been on lockdown.
Passions of mine include:
-	The arts: I’m a very creative individual as I did a lot singing and theatre growing up, and dabble into sketching and photography here and there too.
-	Food and drinks: I’ve worked in hospitality for five years as a waiter, bartender and supervisor. As a result, I love going out to experience different venues and what food and drinks Melbourne has to offer.
