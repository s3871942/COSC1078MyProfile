<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I’m Australian born Vietnamese and I have lived in Melbourne my whole life. My family migrated back in the 80’s like many others seeking a better life and future. Up until recently I had been working as a hospitality professional. Unfortunately, like many around the world working in the service industry, I no longer have consistent work due to the COVID-19 outbreak; as a result, I decided to use this as an opportunity to re-skill and am now enrolled into the COVID-19 Information Technology short-course at RMIT.
Passions of mine include:
-	Music and Art: I’m a very creative individual and as a result I did a lot of singing and theatre growing up as well as dabbling into sketching and photograph.
-	Food and Beverages: Having worked in the hospitality industry and being surrounded by food and beverages, I really enjoy going out to a restaurant and/or bar to appreciate what’s on offer. There’s always time for a drink.
</p>

<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
<p>I love new technology whenever it comes out. Finding out the new features of the latest iPhone model or iOS update, checking out the latest gaming peripherals, and finding out about the latest gadgets and tech. I love it all because I appreciate the innovation and enjoy seeing how these new iterations in design and technology can aid and simplify our lives. My interest in IT began around the time I started studying Visual-Communication in high school and Design/Landscape Architecture at uni. I loved the design elements of it all but I found that I enjoyed the process of learning and using applications on the computer to be a lot more fun.
The reason I decided to study at RMIT is because I have studied Landscape Architectural Design here in the past. Although I didn’t complete my degree, I did have an enjoyable experience at RMIT which was enough to bring me back.
During my studies I hope to learn the more technical side of technology and what kind of work goes on behind the scenes to make all aspects of our lives more comfortable and convenient.

<h2>Ideal job</h2>
<p>The job position listed above is for a full-time Computer and System Engineer at the NSW Business College, which is a registered training organisation that provides qualifications to domestic and international students. In this role the main responsibilities include establishing and maintaining the school’s network, systems, and database.
This position appeals to me because I like the idea of working with computers and networks, specifically how-to set-up a network and how to maintain it for smooth operations. As a bit of a perfectionist and someone who loves structure and order, I think it would be a lot of fun to work with databases as well.
Requirements of the jobs:
●	Bachelor of Information Technology or equivalent
●	Relevant knowledge, experience and skills with NAT, Routing and VLAN
●	Management and maintenance of database and cloud-based servers
●	Able to work in a team environment with strong communications skills
●	Understanding of market trends and the ability to work with strong analytical and time management skills
My current experience in IT is limited to what I’ve learnt in building and maintaining my custom computer and its operations, setting up my home wireless network, and minor OS and software fixes for friends and family. I have my Certificate IV in Management and Leadership and I have five years of hospitality experience working in busy, high-volume restaurants, pubs, bars, and nightclubs. As a result of my hospitality career, I have developed strong interpersonal, communication, and teamwork skills; problem solving skills from managing restaurant and function bookings; basic knowledge of information systems from using booking applications and POS systems; and an understanding of small businesses and public relations.
In order for me to land this type of job in the future I need to obtain a bachelor in either Information Technology or Business (Information Systems). This will give me the qualification required and the education to establish a strong foundation of knowledge to build upon. Upon completing my studies, I would then go into an internship in my desired field to specialise my knowledge and build connections within the industry. Hopefully I land a job at the end of the internship and if I don’t, at least I’ll have the necessary work experience for the role.

According to my Adventurer personality type I am creative and like to challenge traditional barriers and societal norms with experiments in beauty and behaviour. Adventurers enjoy exploring and learning new skills although they can get distracted very easily, growing bored and losing interest when something becomes mandatory. Often enough this means a lot of great ideas and unfinished projects.
In the workplace Adventurers struggle with tightly held traditions and strict procedures, are not ones to like being controlled, and loathe being micromanaged. Rules are just someone else’s way of doing things. Adventurers are tolerant and friendly and prefer working as equals with their colleagues, sharing advice and ideas to solve practical problems. As mentioned earlier Adventurers aren’t known for their long-term focus, but rather for being adaptable and spontaneous. Using unconventional methods and sometimes risky ones to find a way to get something done. Clearly set goals and an open sandbox will allow Adventurer personality types to thrive.
My preferred learning style is visual, using my sight to process and understand the world around me. Visual learners can visualise what they’re learning in their head and tend to close their eyes to recall information. If they are bored, they are more than likely to find something to watch.
After taking all this into account and considering how it may influence my behaviour in a team, I believe a supportive team environment is where I can do my best; working together towards a unified goal harmoniously and being receptive of each other’s ideas. A team to me is an accumulation of experience and knowledge from different people with different perspectives. With this philosophy in mind, and according to my personality tests, I’ll be able to listen to my team members and collaborate in a way to ensure everyone is heard and that no one person is dictating the direction of the group. With my bright personality, I hope to lighten up team meetings to create a positive and friendly environment. If conflict does arise however, it is important for each party to communicate and understand where each other is coming from, and I believe I can mediate such a situation.
When forming my team, I think it would be important to find people with strong drives and planning abilities. Since my personality type has weak long-term focus and the potential to get distracted easily, having team-members with strong time-management skills and structure can help me stay on track. It would also be important for me to find team members who have different perspectives; a new perspective will lead to educated debates, exposing one to new ideas and learning in the process.

<h2>Project idea</h2>

<h3>Virtual Companion</h3>
<p>A virtual assistant that lives in your mobile device and presented as a virtual mascot that travels freely on your apps providing assistance and improving different aspects of the users’ everyday life, with the users’ wellbeing at its core operation. Whether that is providing personalised advice to improve overall wellbeing, to offering companionship to the user. Highly interactive and able to sync up to the internet and the ever-advancing technology in our modern world, the virtual assistant will be able to assist in simple everyday tasks to increase the quality of life for the user. Looking for a recipe to cook? Want to find the latest news? Or maybe you’d like to call or text someone? Just ask your virtual companion and they will do it for you. No need to pick up your phone.</p>

<h3>Motivation and Inspiration</h3>
<p>What inspired this project for me was Queer Eye on Netflix. In the show nominees are selected to receive a makeover from the Fab 5, five gay men who each specialise in Culture, Food, Fashion, Grooming and Design. Each episode will focus on one nominee, exposing the story and struggle that have led their life into disarray. Through the episode the Fab 5 teach the nominee simple, but often overlooked, skills such as self-care and understanding their self-worth to help them build up confidence and overcome their individual struggles and take their first step in moving forward with their lives.
Ignorance of healthy eating or not knowing how to cook. Leading a busy lifestyle and not being able to find time to relax and unwind. Not physically presenting ourselves at our 100% because we lack the confidence to try a different style or simply lack the knowledge. All these things can drastically affect an individual’s mental wellbeing and quality of life. A messy life is a manifestation of a messy mind. And that’s where the virtual companion comes in.
</p>

<h3>Features and Functions</h3>
<p>With the focus on companionship, this virtual assistant is different compared to others on the market. The virtual companion will be able to initiate interaction with the user. Simple things such as saying “good morning” when the user wakes up or asking how the user’s day was once they get home. Based on the user’s response, the virtual assistant can provide suggestions targeted towards improving the user’s wellbeing. For example, you’ve just come home from a run and you’re sprawled on the couch. You’re all sweaty, tired, and dehydrated. Your virtual companion knows you’ve been on a run based on GPS tracking and your daily planner that it’s synced to. It’ll ask you how your run was, and after you respond, proceed to suggest cool-down exercises to relax and stretch out muscles or a juice/smoothie recipe to refresh and rehydrate. Or, say you just got off the phone after making plans with your best friend; your virtual companion will create a new event on your calendar app for you to confirm and lock in.
As mentioned before the virtual companion’s intent is to encourage healthier choices to improve the user’s wellbeing. By monitoring the user’s activities and habits it can provide suggestions and alternatives for users to look after themselves. Screen time information can be used to encourage users to take a break more often from their phones, or suggest an alternative activity to encourage the user to be more active. If the user is up late getting lost into videos because they can’t sleep, the virtual companion will politely remind the user it’s late and provide a list of techniques found on the web to help encourage sleep. Perhaps the user has been ordering take out too much lately, then the virtual companion will suggest quick and easy recipes for the user to encourage healthier eating.
Technology is at the point where a lot of information can be tracked. By utilising this information it’s possible for the virtual companion to achieve a deeper level of interaction with the user. Smart technology is also becoming more advanced especially when it comes to homes and designs. Modern homes can now have multiple elements controlled remotely on a single system: lights, blinds, heating, cooling, entertainment, security, etc. Users will be able to use their virtual assistant to synchronise and control their smart-home system. This will allow the virtual companion to feel more real like an entity and provide the user strong control over their environment.
All these features thus far show the potential the virtual companion has in assisting users in their everyday life. However, to help make the virtual companion feel “alive”, it should be able to express emotions. Even if it is just a pre-programed response, it will allow the user to connect to the virtual assistant on a deeper emotional level. To achieve this, emotions will simply be expressed via the virtual assistant’s model when paired with specific responses.
</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>The creation of the virtual assistant will require a program language such as JavaScript that we can use as building blocks and Eclipse as the language editor to manipulate said building blocks. To help us develop and train the complex algorithms we’ll need a software library for dataflow and differentiable programming, which will act as a framework for neural networks and machine learning. To do this we can use TensorFlow, which is an open-source machine learning library which helps to develop machine learning models.
Skills Required (100 words) – The project aims to create a virtual companion, therefore extensive programming skills are required to bring this project to life. Being able to write programs, develop software and creating complex algorithms is a must. The project aims to create a virtual assistant that will learn the user’s habits over time and become personalised to the individual. The project will require the use of specific and specialised programs, which would require strong knowledge and study into the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Outcome (100 words) – The outcome of this project is to create more than just a virtual assistant that provides convenience, but to create a companion for users to connect with. Humans are social creatures and crave some form of intrapersonal interactions, which is very evident now considering the state of the world. Covid-19 and the isolation we all have experienced from quarantine has shown us how hard it can be to go without social interaction. As our mental health declines, we start to neglect our diet, appearance, and therefore our overall physical health. The virtual companion can negate this decline and achieve making this connection with the right responses that encourage us to be our best self.
