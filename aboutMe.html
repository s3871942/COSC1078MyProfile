                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p>I’m Australian born Vietnamese and I have lived in Melbourne my whole life. My family migrated back in the 80’s like many others seeking a better life and future. Up until recently I had been working as a hospitality professional. Unfortunately, like many around the world working in the service industry, I no longer have consistent work due to the COVID-19 outbreak; as a result, I decided to use this as an opportunity to re-skill and am now enrolled into the COVID-19 Information Technology short-course at RMIT.</p>
                  <h3>Passions of mine include:</h3>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Music and Art: I’m a very creative individual and as a result I did a lot of singing and theatre growing up as well as dabbling into sketching and photography.</li>
                     <li>Food and Beverage: Having worked in the hospitality industry and being surrounded by different cuisines, spirits and wines, I really enjoy going out to a restaurant and/or bar to appreciate what’s on offer. There’s always time for a drink.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <hr class="major" />
                  <h3>Interest in I.T.</h3>
                  <p>I love new technology whenever it comes out. Finding out the new features of the latest iPhone model or iOS update, checking out the latest gaming peripherals, and finding out about the latest gadgets and tech. I love it all because I appreciate the innovation and enjoy seeing how these new iterations in design and technology can aid and simplify our lives. My interest in IT began around the time I started studying Visual-Communication in high school and Design/Landscape Architecture at uni. I loved the design elements of it all but I found that I enjoyed the process of learning and using applications on the computer to be a lot more fun.<br>
                     <br>The reason I decided to study at RMIT is because I have studied Landscape Architectural Design here in the past. Although I didn’t complete my degree, I did have an enjoyable experience at RMIT which was enough to bring me back.<br>
                     <br>During my studies I hope to learn the more technical side of technology and what kind of work goes on behind the scenes to make all aspects of our lives more comfortable and convenient.<p>
                  <hr class="major" />
                  <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
                  <p>The job position <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50318336?type=standard#searchRequestToken=84932104-e444-4f1e-82f0-b33e59fcde23">I found interesting</a> is for a full-time Computer and System Engineer at the NSW Business College, which is a registered training organisation that provides qualifications to domestic and international students. In this role the main responsibilities include establishing and maintaining the school’s network, systems, and database.<br>
                    <br>This position appeals to me because I like the idea of working with computers and networks, specifically how-to set-up a network and how to maintain it for smooth operations. As a bit of a perfectionist and someone who loves structure and order, I think it would be a lot of fun to work with databases as well.<br>
                    <br>Requirements of the jobs:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Bachelor of Information Technology or equivalent</li>
                      <li>Relevant knowledge, experience and skills with NAT, Routing and VLAN</li>
                      <li>Management and maintenance of database and cloud-based servers</li>
                      <li>Able to work in a team environment with strong communications skills</li>
                      <li>Understanding of market trends and the ability to work with strong analytical and time management skills</li>
                    </ul>
                    My current experience in IT is limited to what I’ve learnt in building and maintaining my custom computer and its operations, setting up my home wireless network, and minor OS and software fixes for friends and family. I have my Certificate IV in Management and Leadership and I have five years of hospitality experience working in busy, high-volume restaurants, pubs, bars, and nightclubs. As a result of my hospitality career, I have developed strong interpersonal, communication, and teamwork skills; problem solving skills from managing restaurant and function bookings; basic knowledge of information systems from using booking applications and POS systems; and an understanding of small businesses and public relations.<br>
                    <br>In order for me to land this type of job in the future I need to obtain a bachelor in either Information Technology or Business (Information Systems). This will give me the qualification required and the education to establish a strong foundation of knowledge to build upon. Upon completing my studies, I would then go into an internship in my desired field to specialise my knowledge and build connections within the industry. Hopefully I land a job at the end of the internship and if I don’t, at least I’ll have the necessary work experience for the role.

                  <h3>Overview</h3>
                  <p>According to my Adventurer personality type I am creative and like to challenge traditional barriers and societal norms with experiments in beauty and behaviour. Adventurers enjoy exploring and learning new skills although they can get distracted very easily, growing bored and losing interest when something becomes mandatory. Often enough this means a lot of great ideas and unfinished projects.
                     <br>
                     <br>In the workplace Adventurers struggle with tightly held traditions and strict procedures, are not ones to like being controlled, and loathe being micromanaged. Rules are just someone else’s way of doing things. Adventurers are tolerant and friendly and prefer working as equals with their colleagues, sharing advice and ideas to solve practical problems. As mentioned earlier Adventurers aren’t known for their long-term focus, but rather for being adaptable and spontaneous. Using unconventional methods and sometimes risky ones to find a way to get something done. Clearly set goals and an open sandbox will allow Adventurer personality types to thrive.
                     <br>
                     <br>My preferred learning style is visual, using my sight to process and understand the world around me. Visual learners can visualise what they’re learning in their head and tend to close their eyes to recall information. If they are bored, they are more than likely to find something to watch.
                     <br>
                     <br>They say you should take these types of tests with a grain of salt, but I honestly feel that the results describe me perfectly. I personally have clashed many times in the past with people micromanaging me. There is no one way to do anything, everyone has their own style and method that works for them.
                  </p>
                  <h3>What it means to me</h3>
                  <p>After taking all this into account and considering how it may influence my behaviour in a team, I believe a supportive team environment is where I can do my best; working together towards a unified goal harmoniously and being receptive of each other’s ideas. A team to me is an accumulation of experience and knowledge from different people with different perspectives. With this philosophy in mind, and according to my personality tests, I’ll be able to listen to my team members and collaborate in a way to ensure everyone is heard and that no one person is dictating the direction of the group. With my bright personality, I hope to lighten up team meetings to create a positive and friendly environment. If conflict does arise however, it is important for each party to communicate and understand where each other is coming from, and I believe I can mediate such a situation.
                     <br>
                     <br>When forming my team, I think it would be important to find people with strong drives and planning abilities. Since my personality type has weak long-term focus and the potential to get distracted easily, having team-members with strong time-management skills and structure can help me stay on track. It would also be important for me to find team members who have different perspectives; a new perspective will lead to educated debates, exposing one to new ideas and learning in the process.
